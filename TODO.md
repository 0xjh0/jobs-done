## Milestone: Sharable viable product

- [ ] React Native (start with this to figure out design constraints and avoid rewriting code)
- [ ] Fixed header
  - [ ] Logo (resets state on click)
  - [ ] Info button to access onboarding
  - [ ] Edit button
- [ ] Register page (opened on Edit as guest)
  - [ ] Server, db and session
- [ ] Edit steps and activities page
- [ ] Onboarding: What and why
- [x] Proper font, colors and spacing
- [ ] Medium article or Twitter thread

Nice to have:

- [x] Animated checkbox
- [ ] Router (so native back button goes back in steps)
- [x] Fade in next steps (by rendering them all the time)
